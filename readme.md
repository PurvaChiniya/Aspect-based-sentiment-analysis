This repository contains the implementation of BERT models for Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (TABSA), trained and tested on the SentiHood Dataset. 
The models implemented were proposed in the paper [Utilizing BERT for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Constructing Auxiliary Sentence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09588.pdf).
Experiments are conducted on the [code](https://github.com/HSLCY/ABSA-BERT-pair) from the paper, with changes from myself.
